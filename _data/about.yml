paragraph1: >
  I am currently studying for a master's degree in computer science and technology at Huzhou Normal University. My main research direction is computer vision, involving object detection, behavior detection, 3D model generation, etc.
paragraph2: >
  In the past, I studied at Zhejiang Wanli University, and my research directions were mainly image processing, fingerprint fusion, face recognition, etc.
  I published a paper *Can Image Quality Metrics Detect Face Liveness?* at the EI conference 2023 ICCC, exploring the use of image quality algorithms to improve the accuracy of facial recognition and improve the lightweight of the model.
  I have also helped forklift companies optimize obstacle detection algorithms and improve the accuracy of obstacle detection.
